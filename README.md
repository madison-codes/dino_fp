## Functional Programming in JavaScript

We're going to start slow and simple, master building a pure function and then take things from there. 

## (SIMPLE) PURE FUNCTIONS

### Add

Create a pure function that finds the sum of two parameters. 

```
function add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}
console.log(add(2, 2)); // prints 4
```

### Multiply

It's your turn! Build a pure function that multiplies two parameters.

```
function multiple(x, y) {
  return x * y; 
} 
console.log(add(3, 3)); // prints 9
```
</p></details>

## LOOPS

### Maps

{{ MADISON }}

### Rewrite A For Loop as a Map

### Functors
A functor is a map that's loopable — something you can call `.map` on. 

### Recursion

# thing
MADISON SIMPLE
addOne (one parameter) as we would normally do — not pure
Add one pure function
MADISON LOOPS
MAPS: ARRAY
MADISON — ARRAY: Loop as we would normally do (for loop)
MADISON — Rewrite for loop as a map
FUNCTOR — A map that’s loopable. Something you can call map on.
EMILY RECURISON: NUMBERS
 EMILY — NUMBERS: Loop
 EMILY — Recursive loop that accomplishes the same thing
